                <h4> Going through a breakup sucks</h4>
                <p>When it's over belive it or not both parties are hurt, and feel broke. Durning this process is time to heal 
                    cry if you need to, go for walks, and take a few days off to yourself to reflect.
                </p>

                <p> When you're done, make sure to hangout out with friends, spend time with loved ones.
                    i know you don't feel great right now, i promise in the due time you will.
                    you may feel so lowkey and just not confident in yourself. But it will pass my dear:)
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief</h4>
                <p> you're shocked it may have felt so sudden you, believe it or not. they might have been thinking about it for months or weeks a head, so please
                    for your sanity. Don't try to convince them that you'll change, or want to work things out. They've already made up their minds week or months ago.
                    simply state your peace that you'll like to work things out, but they change their minds. they can conact you in the future
                </p>
                
                <h4> No rebounds</h4>
                <p>
                  Please and thank you, don't try to get into a another relationships shorty after. You'll just hurt someone else in the long run, trust me.
                  as a person who's been on the rebounder end it sucks. Take at least 5 months to a year off dating, get new hobbies, be active, and help other out.
